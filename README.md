## üöÑ Speedy 3D - A Quick Intro to Three.js & React

This workshop was originally created for Hack The North 2021! My personal motivation was to:

- learn through teaching, Feynman technique style
- share some of the (truly incredible) things possible through Three.js

In order to get the most out of this workshop you should be comfortable with the following concepts:

- Basic JavaScript Syntax
- Basic React

### Pre-Workshop Checklist

## ü•≥ Setup

To get started, clone the repository and install the dependencies.

```
git clone https://github.com/ansonyuu/workshop-threejs
cd workshop-threejs
yarn
```

If you want to start from scratch and follow the tutorial, feel free to switch to the empty starter branch. You can do so by entering the following in your command line. If you just want to see the final demo, feel free to skip this step.
